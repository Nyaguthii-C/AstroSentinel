# AstroSentinel üååüõ°Ô∏è

AstroSentinel is an Express.js web application that combines HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide an interactive map displaying light pollution levels. The map showcases markers with [SQM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_quality_meter#:~:text=A%20sky%20quality%20meter%20\(SQM,square%20arcsecond%22%20favored%20by%20astronomers.) measurements and [Bortle scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bortle_scale) values, allowing users to visualize and contribute to a collective understanding of light pollution.

## Project Structure üìÅ
The directories and files in this project are:  
- **config/:** Contains database configuration files (`db.js`).
- **models/:** Houses Mongoose models for interacting with the database(`users.js`, `markers.js`)
- **routes/:** Includes route files, separating different functionalities into modular components.
- **views/:** Contains the views for rendering the project's front-end(.ejs, .js and .css files) 
- **server.js:** The main entry point of the application.
- **package.json and package-lock.json:** list of project dependencies and their versions.

## Database Configuration üõ†Ô∏è

The database configuration is handled in the `config/db.js` file. This file uses the `dotenv` package to load environment variables, including the database connection string. To set up the database configuration:

1. **Create an .env file:**
   - In the root directory, create a file named `.env`.
   - Add the following content, replacing `your_actual_database_url_with_password` with your MongoDB connection string:

     ```plaintext
     DB_URL=your_actual_database_url_with_password
     ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   - Run the following command to install the required packages:

     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

3. **Start the application:**
   - Run the application using the following command:

     ```bash
     node server.js
     ```

   The application should now connect to the database using the provided connection string.

## OAuth2 Configuration üîê
To enable OAuth2 authentication in the application, set up the necessary credentials and environment variables.  

Setting up Google OAuth2 Credentials:
1. **Create OAuth2 Credentials**:
   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), and create a new project if needed.
   - Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials" and create OAuth2 credentials (Client ID and Client Secret) for this project.
2. **Set up Redirect URI**:
   - Configure the redirect URI for the application in the OAuth2 credentials.
   - Use the appropriate redirect URI based on the environment. For example:
     - For local development: `http://localhost:3000/auth/google/callback`
     - For testing with OAuth2 Playground: `https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground`
3. **Set Environment Variables**:
   - Add the following environment variables to the `.env` file in the root directory of this project:
     ```plaintext
     EMAIL=YOUR_GOOGLE_EMAIL_HERE
     REFRESH_TOKEN=PASTE_REFRESH_TOKEN_HERE
     CLIENT_SECRET=PASTE_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE
     CLIENT_ID=PASTE_CLIENT_ID_HERE
     ```
   - These values can be obtained from Google Developer Console. For more guidance on creating OAuth 2.0 API Credentials, refer to [Creating OAuth 2.0 API Credentials](https://dev.to/chandrapantachhetri/sending-emails-securely-using-node-js-nodemailer-smtp-gmail-and-oauth2-g3a).
